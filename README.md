# qaul.net [![pipeline status](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net/commits/master)

**qaul.net** is an Internet independent ad-hoc wireless mesh-network
suite that harnesses the power of everyday devices such as computers
and smartphones to create a **Non-Centralized**, **Mesh Network** on
which users can share files, have voice chats and send each other
messages, however the power of qaul.net allows endless services over
the service API. qaul.net removes the dependence on the centralized
services such as the Internet and cellular networks and creates a
network that anyone can be part of and share freely with no censorship
what so ever.
