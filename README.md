**qaul** is a decentralised networking project, aiming to create easy
to use solutions to ad-hoc wireless communication.  It supports many
common desktop operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS, BSD, ...),
and Android mobile phones.  iOS support is on the roadmap.

**qaul.net** is both a cross-platform application, implementing
**messaging**, **filesharing**, and **voice calls**, but also a
**development toolkit** to create fully decentralised third-party
applications.

In order to be able to run on unpriviledged mobile platforms qaul.net
implements **decentralised routing protocols** and utilities entirely
in userspace.  The codebase is largely written in
[Rust](https://rustlang.org), with only a few compatibility components
being written in more platform specific languages.

All parts of the project are contained in this repository.  Following
is an overview of the available components.  Each component has
additional information.

| [emberweb]  | Cross-platform web interface bundled in with various user clients |
| [libqaul]   | Core library of the qaul.net ecosystem.  Provides networking abstractions, user management and discovery |
| [licenses]  | Set of license texts that are in use in this repository |
| [netmods]   | Platform-specific networking interface drivers |
| [nix]       | [nix](https://nixos.org) related build utilities |

## Overview

Most traditional networking infrastructure (both the transmission
layer, as well as applications) operate in a very centralised way.
Clients connect to servers, and devices to towers.  This makes it very
vulnerable to attacks.  Natural disasters or opressive governments can
easily shut down communication for millions of people, potentially
putting people at risk, and slowing down any activist movement.

qaul.net aims to solve this issue by creating decentralised circuits
between devices directly.  Additionally, it's routing approach takes
into account that connections are imperfect, and that a stable link
between two devices might not be possible.  For this scenario the
network caches undelivered messages, carrying them towards their
destination until the recipient comes back online.

Routing in a qaul network is done via a users public keys, creating a
32 byte large address space.  Connecting devices together happens via
channel-specific drivers.  When creating a circuit, roaming between
different connection modes is common.

## How to use

There's no single way to use qaul.net.  Various platforms support
different clients, and a qaul network can consist of many different
components interacting with each other.  To get started, check out the
[user manual]!
