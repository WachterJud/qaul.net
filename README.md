==================================

power of everyday devices such as computers and smartphone to create a 
**Democratic**, **Non-Centralized**, **Mesh Network** on which users can 
share files, have voice chats and send each other messages, however the 
power of qaul.net allows and endless feature set as anyone can run any 
LAN-based application over the network. qaul.net removes the dependence 
on the centralized services such as the Internet and cellular networks 
and creates a network that anyone can be part of and share freely with 
no censorship what so ever.
