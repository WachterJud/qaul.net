//! Encrypted record-oriented database
//!
//! **Experimental:** please note that this database was writted for
//! [qaul.net](git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net), which itself
//! is a very experimental platform.  There will be data retention
//! bugs, and you shouldn't use Alexandria unless you're okay with
//! losing the data you're storing!
//!
//! A multi-payload, zone-encrypting, journaled persistence module,
//! built with low-overhead applications in mind.
//!
//! `alexandria` provides an easy to use database interface with
//! transactions, merges and dynamic queries, ensuring that your
//! in-memory representation of data never get's out-of-sync with your
//! on-disk representation. Don't burn your data.
