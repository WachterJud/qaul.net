Android Device Compatibility
============================

Requirements
------------

* qaul.net requires the android devices to be rooted! 

* qaul.net needs the IBSS/Ad-hoc wifi mode. This Wifi-Standard mode was 
  removed by google. 
  * On Android < 4.x IBSS mode can be activated via the wext (wireless 
    extensions). 
    Some vendors ship also their 4.x devices with wext.
  * On Android >= 4 IBSS mode can be activated on some devices via 
    wpa_supplicant.
* qaul.net needs ARM and Android > 2.3 Gingerbread
  (due to before unsupported pthread functions in pjsip). 
* The Android device needs to be rooted.
