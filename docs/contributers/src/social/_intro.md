# Social Documentation

Contributing to a FOSS project always has a social component.
Whether you are providing a patch, a new feature or other content,
knowing where and how to engage with the project will make everybodies
lives easier.


## Communication

The qaul.net projet uses a [zulip] as development and social chat. Feel free to drop by!

We also have an [announcement mailing list], which is very low volume.

If you don't want to or can't use zulip, we also have a [community mailing list], which is mixed volume.
You can post questions there, show off your projects using `libqaul` or submit patches to the project!

[announcement mailing list]: https://lists.sr.ht/~qaul/announcements
[community mailing list]: https://lists.sr.ht/~qaul/community


## Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** be nice!

We want to foster an open and engaging atmosphere for qaul.net and the development community around it.
Because of this we follow the ["Contributor Covenant" code of conduct].
A copy of it should have been included in the sources for this book.
