# How to contribute?

First of all: you're cool! ðŸ˜Ž

Development of qaul.net happens mostly on [github](https://github.com/qaul)
with an open development & support chat on [zulip](https://qaul.zulipchat.com).
If you have any questions getting started, please come by!

## Submitting a PR

- If a relevant issue exists, please tag in your description, not the title.
- Include a short description of the accumulative changes
- If you want your history to be rebased/ merged, please clean it up to be useful.
  Otherwise we will probably squash it.
- Feel free to open a work-in-progress PR as a place to have a discussion
  about changes or to get feedback.

## Submitting an e-mail patch

If you can't contribute via github (for whatever reason),
you're very welcome to submit your patch via e-mail.

The easiest way of doing this is to configure `git send-email`.
Patches should be submitted to the community mailing list at [~qaul/community@lists.sr.ht](mailto:~qaul/community@lists.sr.ht)

**Manually**

- Send an e-mail with the title `[PATCH]: <your title here>`.
- Format your patch with `git diff -p`
- Don't send HTML e-mail!
- Make sure your line-wrapping is wide enough to allow the patch to stay un-wrapped!
