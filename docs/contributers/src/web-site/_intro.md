## Web Site Development Quick Start
### Install HUGO

[HUGO] can be installed on almost every platform. 
Learn how to install it on your computer on [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#quick-install)

You need HUGO version 0.55 or newer to be able to test and run the web site.
To check your installed version you may run the following command:

```bash
hugo version
```


### Get the Web Site Sources 

Clone or download the [github repository] of the web site. All needed files (templates, content, images) are in this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qaul/qaul-website.git
```


### Run and Test the Web Site locally

**Troube Shooting**

If you're geting an error without changing anything, check your installed HUGO version (run `hugo version` on the command line). You need at least version 0.55 or later to be able to run and test the web site.
