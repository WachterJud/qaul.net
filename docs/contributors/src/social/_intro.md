# Social Documentation

Contributing to a FOSS project always has a social component.
Whether you are providing a patch, a new feature or other content,
knowing where and how to engage with the project will make everybodies
lives easier.


## Communication

The qaul.net projet uses [IRC] as development and social chat. Feel free to drop by!

Our [community mailing list] is for discussion and long-form postings. 
You can post questions there, show off your projects using `libqaul` or submit patches to the project! The mailing list is mixed volume.

We also have an [announcement mailing list], which is very low volume, where you will get informed about new versions and releases of the qaul.net software and occasional project related news.

We have an open weekly developer voice chat meeting.
We are meeting Mondays, at 17:00 UTC on the online platform [jitsi]. 
The meetings are announced on the community mailing list, where you can find the records of the meetings as well.
They are open and free to join for everyone, feel free to drop in.

## Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** be nice!

We want to foster an open and engaging atmosphere for qaul.net and the development community around it.
Because of this we follow the ["Contributor Covenant" code of conduct].
A copy of it should have been included in the sources for this book.
