# qaul.net

As mentioned in the introduction, it's important to make the
distinction between the qaul.net ecosystem of libraries (documented
after this section), a "qaul network", consisting of meshed devices,
and "qaul.net" the application that you can install on your phone and
laptop.

qaul.net is a collection of services written by the project developers
themselves and kept in the same tree as the libraries that power them.
It provides a GUI on various platforms that is meant as a referenc
implementation for third-party developers.

The following pages will outline the services that get bundled into
qaul.net, what they can do and how you can use them in a third-party
application.
