# HTTP Api Documentation

This guide documents the qaul.net HTTP Api. The Api primarily speaks [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) 
which has its own [Documentation](https://jsonapi.org/format/).

This documentation is **highly out of date** and will be updated in the future. If you wish to use
the HTTP Api in the mean time I recommend you check out the [Example Session] for an example
of the Api in action. If you have any questions, please feel free to ping me, jess3jane, in the
IRC channel. 

This guide is divided into three sections:

- [Topics] which provides a structured walkthrough of some of the core components of the Api
- [Entities] which documents the various JSON:API entities used throughout the Api
- [Endpoints] which documents the behavior of individual endpoints of the Api
