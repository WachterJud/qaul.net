# Social Documentation

This section outlines social structures of the qaul.net project, to
make engaging with us as easy as possible!


## Communication

We have an open weekly developer voice chat meeting.  We are meeting
Mondays, at 17:00 UTC on the online platform [jitsi].

## Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** be nice!

We want to foster an open and engaging atmosphere for qaul.net and the development community around it.
Because of this we follow the ["Contributor Covenant" code of conduct].
A copy of it should have been included in the sources for this book.
