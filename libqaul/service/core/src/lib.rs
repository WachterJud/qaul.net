//! Provides the core service layer with user management
//!
//! The idea behind this crate is to wrap all the "core" functions
//! of the `libqaul` service API in another layer to make them easier
//! to consume for the HTTP API.
//!
//! Depending on how important this is, this crate might either be
//! a shim crate, or be removed again in the future because it's redundant.
