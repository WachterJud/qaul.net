//! # `libqaul` service API
//!
//! The idea behind this interface is further
//! documented in the `contribute` book. It goes
//! into detail about using it to write decentralised
//! networking services, using qaul.net as a backend.
//!
//! `qaul.net` itself provides a few primary services
//! for "messaging", "file sharing" and "VoIP",
//! as well as a sort of hidden, management "core"
//! service.
//! All of them are implemented via this API,
//! allowing external developers to write their own
//! services using qaul.net libraries and networks.
//!
//! ## Models
//!
//! Models defined in this submodule are different
//! from any other models defined in `libqaul`:
//! they are the public representations, i.e.
//! only fields that are relevant for service
//! developers to interact with, not including
//! shared service state or secrets.
