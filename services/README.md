# qaul.net services

If you are an end-user, looking for applications, check out
[clients](../clients) instead!

Following is a collection of services that use qaul.net to do
networking.  None of them rely on centralised servers or
infrastructure, and can operate on a completely ad-hoc network.  Some
smaller example services are included as examples on how to use
qaul.net in your applications, and what kind of usecases it can solve.

Note that this is potentially only a small selection of services that
use qaul.net.  We encourage you to write your own that don't have to
be part of this repository; we are not a single source of truth.
