Strongly typed, embedded record database with seamless encryption at
rest storage.  Supports key-value Diff transactions, as well as
externally loaded binary payloads.  Supports encrypted metadata
without extra configuration.

Alexandria has the following features:

- Store data on internal db path
- Query the database by path or dynamic search tags
- Subscribe to events based on query
- Iterate over query dynamically
- Store data in session or global namespaces

**Notice:** alexandria should be considered experimental and not used
in production systems where data loss is unacceptable.


## How to use

Alexandria requires `rustc` 1.42 to compile.

```rust
use alexandria::{Library, Builder};
use tempfile::tempdir();

let dir = tempdir().unwrap();
let lib = Builder::new()
              .offset(dir.path())
              .root_sec("car horse battery staple")
              .build()?


```
